- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrankRock, but you can call me Mat !
- I'm currently studying computer sciences and maths applied to cognitive sciences at the Université Grenoble Alpes
- Previous to that, I obtained a bachelor degree in computer science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Java, and I'd like to start looking into C#, Golang and JavaScript.
- You can find here my personnal projects. In the last few weeks I have discovered the power of python's Bs4, so i'm on a scraping spree.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project, in Python or Java. I'm open to anything, I'm eager to learn.
- 📫 You can contact me on discord at MattV#7337.
